# Calculate the number of gold pieces on a chess board given that then number doubles on each square.
# One gold piece on the first square of a chess board. Two pieces on the second, 4 on the third and so on
# 64 squares on a chess board
# Write code that shows:
# How many gold pieces were on each square, and the total number of gold. 




  # loop to count through 64 times while doubling the previous number
  # retaining the previous numbers.
  # at the end of the program sum all digits. 
  # return the sum.
